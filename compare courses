PROJECT STEM for AP CSP
AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) is a full-year, rigorous course that introduces students
to the foundational concepts of computer science and explores the impact computing and
technology have on our society. The course covers a broad range of foundational topics
including: programming, algorithms, the Internet, big data, digital privacy and security, and the
societal impacts of computing.

About the Course
Project STEM developed this course in partnership with the University of Texas at Austin’s
UTeach Institute. This custom course combines the esteemed UTeach CS Principles curriculum
with additional features and tools specific for a technology-driven student-centered curriculum,
including: instructional lesson videos and slides, worked practice problems, unit project
scaffolding, student activity and task examples and grading rubrics, enhanced online and offline
question banks with College Board-style questions, annotated explanations for all assessment
questions, and a practice mini performance task. Additionally, UTeach’s lesson plans have been
substituted for lesson and unit guides, since they have been revised to focus less on
teacher-driven directives for students (“say this,” “do this,” etc.) and more on teaching tips and
strategies.
All schools using Project STEM’s AP CSP course should use this syllabus.

Course Overview
Prerequisites
The College Board suggests students successfully complete a first year high school Algebra
course prior to enrolling in AP CSP. An Algebra course will provide a strong foundation in
problem solving, basic linear functions, composition of functions, and the Cartesian (x,y)
coordinate system. These skills and topics are essential for student facility in this course. For
further preparation, we recommend students complete our Computer Science Python
Fundamentals course prior to taking this course. That course introduces students to the
fundamentals of computing, providing a foundation on which this course can build.
The College Board adheres to an open enrollment policy for this course, meaning any student
that is willing and academically prepared can participate in the course.
Pedagogical Approach
Project STEM’s AP CS Principles course follows the blended learning model. It takes a
student-centered approach powered by technology to help realize the goal of high achievement
for all students. The course promotes student engagement, independent thought and
interactive collaboration with peers. Student-centric lessons, activities and assessments are
paired with augmentative teacher-centric lesson, activity and task guides and reporting to
empower teachers to empower students. Additionally, teacher and student forums with
moderation and input from Project STEM staff and team of teaching assistants provide dynamic
community and support.
Programming Requirements
The coding languages Scratch and Python are both used in this course. Scratch is a free
block-based programming environment that is accessible enough for beginners, yet can support
the development of advanced algorithms used in more complex games and applications. Python
is a text-based language with easy to read and write syntax - perfect for beginning
programmers.

BJC for AP CSP
The authors of the BJC curriculum think that computer programming is one of the most satisfying of all human activities—it's generally fun (when it's not frustrating because of a bug you can't find), but it's what Seymour Papert called "hard fun," mind-stretching and, because the authority is the computer rather than the teacher, a big change from jumping through hoops. It's a game of skill, like chess, but without the competitive aspect, and with useful results beyond the act of programming itself. That's the best reason to study computer science, and we want all kids, not just the ones who fit the nerd stereotype, to experience our joy in programming.

We also think that computer programs (not just the pictures that programs can produce) can be things of beauty. Yes, programs can also be ugly, if they're long sequences of assignment statements with no structure. But good programmers develop a sense of programming aesthetics. This is one reason why it's so important to us to include recursion in the curriculum: A recursive program can generate a complex, intricate computing process from a very small piece of code, and we remember that revelation as the moment when we discovered the beauty of programs.

It's not easy to preserve beauty and joy when translating a course taught by its authors into a curriculum for widespread use. Too much scaffolding in a project and the joy is gone; too little scaffolding and the student feels helpless and incompetent. That's why the original authors from the University of California, Berkeley, formed a partnership with the high school curriculum experts at EDC (Education Development Center). Try the curriculum to see how you think we did.
Every conforming curriculum must teach all of these, but curricula may differ in the amount of emphasis given to each. (The slices in the pies aren't really quantitative, just a suggestive snapshot of how BJC stands out.)

There is much overlap between the Ideas and the Practices. Creativity is an Idea, but Creating is a Practice. Similarly, Abstraction is an Idea, but Abstracting is a Practice. Think of the first pie as representing text in the curriculum materials, and the second pie as representing how we expect students to spend their time. The circles at the center of each pie indicate that the idea of Programming and the practice of Creating are at the center of BJC, and intersect with all the others.

First, the Big Ideas. BJC is proudly Programming-heavy. We believe that Snap!, the programming language we use, allows us to reach a diverse audience of beginners, who may initially not think they're interested in programming, because it combines the ease of use of visual programming with expressive power previously found only in the most sophisticated text-based languages. (More on this below.) We go far beyond the CS Principles requirements, featuring the advanced techniques of recursion and higher order functions.

We view Abstraction as the central idea of computer science, and we emphasize the use of abstraction in the context of programming. This includes both control abstraction to generalize programming patterns and data abstraction to isolate the implementation of an abstract data type from its use.

Our secondary emphasis is on Global Impact, the social implications of computing. We use readings and classroom discussion to explore various aspects of this topic in each unit of the course. Details of the topics and teaching goals are below.

Two of the remaining four topics are more implicit than explicit in our approach. Students exercise Creativity in their programming projects, but we don't talk about it to the same extent as the other topics. Similarly, students develop Algorithms as they program, but we don't often treat algorithms as a separate topic, except when we are teaching about analysis of algorithms and asymptotic orders of growth.

The final category of topics, Data and the Internet, are important and are covered thoroughly, but where possible our coverage takes the form of programming activities rather than, for example, using commercial database software.

Now, about the Practices: The phrase "Computational Artifacts" is meant to encompass videos, slide decks, blogs, programs, music, spreadsheets—anything you can create with a computer. Creating is, we think, by far the most important of the Practices, but the most important artifacts are computer programs! More precisely, if a student is writing a game program, for example, there are two acts of creation happening at once. The student is interested in making a game, and displays creativity in the design of the game. But she creates the game by creating a program, and also displays creativity in the design of the program structure. And the latter is the real computer science.

Just as the idea of abstraction is central to, and inseparable from, the idea of programming, the practice of abstraction is central to programming. We constantly encourage students to use layers of abstraction to structure a programming project.

"Connecting computing" can mean connecting it to hobbies, or connecting it to industry, or to science. But most importantly, for us, students connect computing to its social implications, our secondary focus.

Almost as important is the practice of analyzing programs: debugging, predicting the behavior of someone else's code, and thinking about efficiency. But we would emphasize that this skill is not an end in itself; it serves the ultimate goal of creating programs that work. We're not nearly as interested in analyzing "artifacts" other than programs.

The two remaining practices are important, but less emphasized in BJC. Like most CSP curricula, we use pair programming, so students are constantly talking with their partners and sharing the work. At the beginning of the course we teach the process of pair programming, and in the discussion of social implications of computing students have to communicate their ideas, but communicating and collaborating aren't unique to computer science.
