Group 2: Snap_Scratch

0. Code is written by pulling block out and connecting them. It does allow you to create functions, variables, list, and also allows user input. 
It can also use broadcasting to each sprite.

1. We run the code, by either clicking the sprite, broadcasting a message, or when the green flag is clicked

2. Very minimal syntax errors

3. Strength it is more visual, syntax error you don't have to worry
remix other peoples code, and see inside the project.- reference (edited)

4.Weakness: Scratch cannot see behind the scene. Where as snap and blockly can toggle back between javascript; harder to spot the errors
 Scratch doesn’t let you see “Behind the curtain” in terms of looking at what the block-based code would look like in a text-based language. 
 I know that Blockly (from Code.org) lets you toggle between JavaScript and blocks and Snap! might as well.
